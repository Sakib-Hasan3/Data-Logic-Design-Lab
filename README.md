# Data Logic Design Lab

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains experiments and projects related to **Digital Logic Design (DLD)**. The aim is to help students understand fundamental logic circuits, Boolean algebra, and digital system design using simulation tools like **Proteus 8 Professional**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand fundamental concepts of **digital logic circuits**.
- Design and simulate **combinational & sequential circuits**.
- Implement logic gates, multiplexers, flip-flops, counters, and more.
- Use **Proteus 8 Professional** for circuit simulation.

## 🛠️ Required Software
### 1️⃣ **Proteus 8 Professional** (for simulation)
### 2️⃣ **Arduino IDE** (for microcontroller-based circuits)
### 3️⃣ **Logisim** (for basic circuit design)
